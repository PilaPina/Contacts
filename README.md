This is a simple contact list site for personal use. 
For now, the data (contacts) is run on local storage only, so each user will have their own seperate contact list saved in their browser. 
If you (hi user) clear your browser storage or open this with a different browser you will loose all of your contacts. 

Storage backend will be implemented on a later date. 

- Next.js App Router
- React with Typescript
- CSS modules
- Global CSS variables & theming
- Local Storage
- Accessability features
- Framer-motion for initial loading screen


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
